<h1>Decision Support Help</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The feature provides near-real-time tests that can predict properties for 
a chemical structure and hence decision support.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Open the view <b>Decision Support</b>, available from the menu 
<b>Window > Show view > other...</b> and select <b>Decision Support</b>.
Now, open a chemical structure with 2D coordinates in the chemical editor by 
double-clicking on e.g. a mol/cml file in the <b>Bioclipse Navigator</b>. 
Click the <b>Run</b> button in the local toolbar of the <b>Decision Support</b> view. 
If there are matches, you can select them in the Decision Support view and get 
more detailed decision support, for example a highlighted substructure or the 
full structure of an identical hit in an external database.

<h2>Example</h2>
A compound is predicted as toxic, and a substructure in the chemical editor displays 
the problematic regions. The chemist can now in real time make changes and see how 
these changes are predicted, with the goal to produce new chemical entities.
