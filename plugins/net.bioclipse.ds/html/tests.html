<h1>Decision Support Tests</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The feature provides near-real-time tests that can predict properties for 
a chemical structure and hence decision support.

<h2>Exact match</h2>
This test retrieves the compounds in the Bursi DB that have a matching
InChi key. It also displays the Ames Mutagenicity test result for those
compounds.

<h2>Bursi Nearest Neighbor</h2>
The Bursi DB is searched for compounds, near neighbors, that match the
query molecule. The comparison is made based on cdk fingerprints and
Tanimoto similarity. Any compound with a similarity greater than or
equal to 0.7 is retrieved and the corresponding Ames Mutagenicity test
result is displayed. This plugin makes a classification based on the
number of near neighbors. If the number of neighbors is greater than
zero and the majority of Ames Meutagenicity test results is positive
then the classification is positive, otherwise it is negative.

<h2>Bursi Toxicophores</h2>
A set of toxicophores defined by SMARTS is used to make positive
classifications. If none of them exist in a query molecule the
classification is negative otherwise it is positive.

<h2>Signature Significance</h2>
A QSAR model makes classifications. The model is trained on the Bursi DB
and the descriptor being used is the signature descriptor. If there are
existing signatures in a query molecule, the classification is either
positive or negative, otherwise it is inconclusive. The most significant
signature is displayed in the query molecule.

<h2>Consensus Classification</h2>
The latter three Tests are used together in a consensus fashion where
the majority is used as a classification. If it is a draw the
classification is inconclusive.
