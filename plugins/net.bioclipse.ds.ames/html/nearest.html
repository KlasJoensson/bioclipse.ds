<h1>Ames Nearest Neighbor</h1>
The Ames DB is searched for compounds, near neighbors, that match the
query molecule. The comparison is made based on cdk fingerprints and
Tanimoto similarity. Any compound with a similarity greater than or
equal to 0.7 is retrieved and the corresponding Ames Mutagenicity test
result is displayed. This plugin makes a classification based on the
number of near neighbors. If the number of neighbors is greater than
zero and the majority of Ames Meutagenicity test results is positive
then the classification is positive, otherwise it is negative.
