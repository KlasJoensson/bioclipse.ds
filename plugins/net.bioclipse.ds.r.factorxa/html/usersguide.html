<h1>Decision Support Users Guide</h1>

<h2>The Decision Support Perspective</h2>
A Decision Support Perspective is available to arrange the Bioclipse workbench 
for predicting chemical liabilities. From the main menu, choose <b>Window > Open Perspective </b> 
and then select the Decision Support option.


<h2>Predicting for individual molecules: The Decision Support View</h2>
Open the view <b>Decision Support</b>, available from the menu 
<b>Window > Show view > other...</b> and select <b>Decision Support</b>.
Now, open a chemical structure with 2D coordinates in the chemical editor by 
double-clicking on e.g. a mol/cml file in the <b>Bioclipse Navigator</b>. 
Click the <b>Run</b> button in the local toolbar of the <b>Decision Support</b> view. 
If there are matches, you can select them in the Decision Support view and get 
more detailed decision support, for example a highlighted substructure or the 
full structure of an identical hit in an external database. 
Results may look like the figures below.
<p>
You can make changes in the chemical editor and re-run the models to get an updated result. 
Note the option in the Decision Support View local toolbar to auto-rerun on a chemical edit. 
This way it is possible to, in real time, make changes and see how 
these changes are predicted, allowing for trying different hypothesis.

<h2>Predicting for multiple molecules: Using the Molecules Table</h2>
Open an SD-file in the Bioclipse Molecules Table consisting of the molecules you'd like to evaluate. 
Now, right-click in the Molecules Table and choose an option from the 
<b>Decision Support</b> menu. This will start a calculation in the background, 
note the progress in the status bar or in the <i>Progress View</i>. 
Results may look like the figure below.

There is also the possibility to right-click on an SD-file in the Bioclipse Navigator 
and calculate Decision Support properties, without opening it in the Molecules Table. 
This is faster and the preferred option for larger collections of compounds.
